# NNFS
A repository for learning how to code neural networks in Python and learning the functionality of Git/GitHub at the same time. (Perhaps I should learn markdown while I'm at it). 

The main sources for this will be Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela's Neural Networks from Scratch in Python and the YouTube channel The Coding Train's Git and GitHub for Poets series. As I encounter more material, I'll try to keep up with acknowledgements here.
